# AI-based-HCC-Diagnosis
 This project is supported by HKU and HKEDU

# System requirements and operating system including version numbers
# This project is based on Keras + Tensorflow, deployed on the platform with Centos whose version number is CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)
# The hardware information of the server is as below.CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R)  Gold 6146 CPU @ 3.20 GHz, 2 Thread(s) per core, 12 Core(s) per socket, 2 Socket(s)  ---> 48 CPU(s), GPU: 4 Tesla V100 32 GB, RAM Memory: 500 GB. Although the proposed model is trained on the HPC server, one can reduce the hardware requirement by reducing the resolution of input CT image volume. 

# The version of Keras is 2.2.4, the version of tensorflow is 1.15.0
